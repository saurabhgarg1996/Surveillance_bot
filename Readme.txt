Hello and Welcome to our ITSP project : Surveillance bot.

First you need to setup the server :
(i) Make sure you have python installed in your laptop (preferred version 2.7.x)
(ii) Change the IP address in Server_setup.py code to IP address of your connected network.
(iii) Run that python code and you are done. Your server is Ready.

Install the Oslagbarters app in your mobile and do the necessary
setting in your app to make sure you are connected to that server.

To run arduino mega code you need to install Arduino.
Make sure you have installed it. here's the link : http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software  
Build and run the code in your Arduino Mega and make sure you have 
done the necessary connections according to the pins used in that code.

Finally run that image processing code written in python.

Enjoy shooting your target with that app.

Here's the video link to the working model of our project :
